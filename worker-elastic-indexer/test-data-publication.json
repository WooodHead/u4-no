While tense negotiations between the parties continued, the government initiated a new campaign to regain its legitimacy. This process began with a five-hour-long speech from Hun Sen, in which he expressed a strong desire for reforms, to meet the people’s demands.

In addition, major jurisdictional reforms were conducted to consolidate the area of land gazetted for conservation – placing 42% of the country’s land area under the supervision of the Ministry of the Environment. Other conspicuous reforms, which were clearly aimed to alleviate public pressure in relation to the environment, included: cracking down on illegal logging, cancelling private fishing lots on Tonle Sap lake, banning coastal sand mining, and postponing the construction of a contested hydropower dam in the Areng Valley."

Ministers and leaders of state institutions were ordered frequently to check the prime minister’s Facebook page and to respond to the complaints from the public on the page. It seemed that social media had become the government’s new platform, to appeal to the new, urban middle-class and the emerging young generation of voters – and yet, it is a sword that cuts both ways, as recent less-reform-oriented events indicate."

But the CPP has not given any ground. In the wake of the July 2018 election, the international community is now considering new kinds of pressures upon the regime, such as revoking the EU’s 'everything but arms' (EBA) trade preferences, which have played a vital role in Cambodia’s economic development until now."

Thus, this section explains the nature and effects of Cambodia’s anti-corruption reforms, drawing from the distinction between liberal and democratic reforms (section 2.1 and 2.2), with close observation of outcomes in public finance management (PFM) reform (section 2.3) and decentralisation (section 2.4).

Nonetheless, Rodan and Hughes argue that in political contexts where there is even a minimal consensus around the commitment to market-orientated capitalism, political elites are more likely to find compromise around liberal reforms. This is for two reasons: (i) in the economic sphere, such reforms pay dividends in terms of investor confidence; and (ii) there are political benefits to liberal anti-corruption reforms. In terms of the latter, by emphasising horizontal oversight, regimes can alleviate internal political tensions. For instance, far from produce accountability, institutions of horizontal accountability, like the ACU or the NAA, can 'insulate' decision-making bodies from political scrutiny, and/or create political space to accommodate technical experts, who might otherwise pose a threat to the wider regime of power."

While the convention makes the case for anti-corruption on the basis that corruption erodes democracy and rule of law, it is important to note that the impetus for action for many national governments is often less about democratisation than the pressures of maintaining competitiveness in an increasingly global market."

However, the sheer number of steps around budgetary allocations also diffused centralist power dynamics. By increasing the number of steps in budgetary transfers, a proliferating number of MoEF elites, brokers and middlemen could leverage their authority over the transfer process to extract rents. This enabled some political and economic entrepreneurs to fast track or move diagonally through an otherwise hierarchical patron-client system of neopatrimonialism. FMIS threatens these power dynamics and opportunities because it fixes budgetary disbursements to the allocation specified in the budget, drastically reducing the number of steps required to transfer public funds. Moreover, it provides for new ways to assess, measure and analyse budgetary information. This makes discrepancies, inefficiencies and gatekeeping easier to detect."

In annual budget meetings, the MoEF generally accepts the amount being proposed or tries to negotiate for a reduction where possible.

Although the reasons for this system are complex, one key enabling factor is the lack of transparency and accountability in the police budgets, such that station accountants are completely in the dark as to their annual allocations."

The report mapped a huge range in annual school operational funds (SIG and SOB funds combined), from US$ 248 to US$ 25,833 and it is hard to see how schools on the lower end of allocations can adequately meet quality educational outcomes. As seen in Indonesia, while the regularisation of public finance and increased budgetary allowances has assisted police stations with their operational costs, the actual sums are still below what police chiefs actually need, meaning that institutionalised rent seeking persists."

There needs to be equivalent emphasis on access to understandable and readily available budgetary information, established mechanisms for citizen participation in the drafting and planning process and, most critically, the democratic right to mobilise, associate and indeed agitate for budgetary priorities. Phase Two of PFMRP has emphasised FMIS and the role it plays in modernising and rationalising public finance information management above other forms of accountability. Ultimately, the success of FMIS suggests that Cambodia is on track to achieve its goal of rational public finance management, towards better service delivery, an achievement which needs to be seen as distinct from more ‘accountable’ public finances. As such, we venture that in the immediate to mid-term, the principal beneficiary of phase two is the central government. We suggest that FMIS not only reassures the business community that reform is proceeding apace, but it is an effective tool to extend and consolidate executive and MoEF control. By providing the political elite with the mechanisms and informational tools to assess how resources are allocated, organised and disbursed, FMIS provides the means for the executive to reassert existing neopatrimonial power dynamics."

Political decentralisation is supposed to strengthen vertical accountability by allowing voters to directly elect local politicians who run the local administration. Administrative decentralisation refers to a range of authorities devolved from central to local government so that local administrations can deliver services. Typically, this relies on increased accountability between institutions at the central and local level. Cambodia is no stranger to such reforms, having experienced numerous 'regimes' of decentralisation and re-centralisation, since the 1980s. The current decentralisation regime – the 'decentralisation and deconcentration' (D&D) reforms – commenced after the 1997 coup with consistent involvement from the international donor community. This coincided with the first commune council elections in 2002, and thus the creation of democratically elected local administrative bodies."

This has formed a new, localised space for open political contestation. In contrast, the 2008 Organic Law provides for the indirect elections of district and provincial level councillors. Councils are formed through the voting preferences of the 11,000 commune councillors compelled to vote through the party list system. In the 2009 indirect election the CPP dominated 2249 of 2861 seats.

The 2001 laws on the Administration of the Commune and the ancillary sub-decrees provide the commune with a clear role in 'local administration and development' through the provision of a commune fund, financed by Treasury. Communes are also provided with low level revenue generation powers. Similarly, at the district and provincial level, the Organic Law of 2008 stipulates that district administrations are supposed to 'undertake activities necessary to achieve the purpose of establishing, promoting and sustaining democratic development.' At the commune level, the Law on the Administrative Management of Commune/Sangkat provides a legal basis for councils to implement local democratic governance wherein local communities decide upon funding priorities through open planning processes where citizens are invited to participate. The sub-law decree on Commune/Sangkat Financial Management (2002) further enshrines public participation in budgeting as a right necessary to building responsible government and includes provisions on public access to budgetary information and reporting."

As in Cambodia, we observe the way that China’s anti-corruption reforms serve to personalise political power, whilst centralising and rationalising the administrative state in the face of deepening marketisation. In the second part of this section, we turn to the question of how Cambodia’s political economy might generate internal tensions that could open up spaces for genuine reform.

Indeed, President Xi Jinping's current war against corruption initiated on his ascent to the position of General Secretary in November 2012, is notable as the longest and most pervasive anti-corruption campaign in China's modern history. Over the past five years, more than one million officials have been disciplined for corruption, five times the number netted by previous campaigns."

The policy shift in anti-corruption in China is the reform of the CCDI, the Chinese Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the newly established National Supervision Commission (NSC) or the state security commission and their use as the principal institutions for pursuing corrupt subjects. The CCDI oversees party cadres and the NSC has been formed with oversight responsibility for all management-level public servants including at hospitals and schools. Together these agencies supervise, investigate and punish, with broad interrogation and detention powers and minimal accountability. The CCDI and the NSC, both party-based institutions, have usurped the work of legal institutions, particularly the anti-corruption bureaus in the Central and Local People Protectorate"

These reforms, alternatively labelled 'China 2.0' or China's 'New Normal' by the president, aim to fundamentally transform governance as Chinese growth rates cool and its export orientated strategy for growth meets headwinds in the global financial downturn. These reforms have included a strong emphasis on legal reform, including the centralisation of control over local courts and the professionalisation of the judiciary and the recentralisation of control of personnel, finance and property to the provincial tier from local government. These reforms are low risk politically and, as in Cambodia, are largely seen as part of a wider effort to rationalise and standardise public administration as part of a drive to increase service quality. As in Cambodia, reforms have emphasised public finance management reform, particularly the development of more stringent systems for allocating and transferring public monies, including increased budgetary transparency to the public via e-platforms. However, the effects of these reforms have been to discipline regional government and extend the power of the central administration."

In Sri Lanka, high rates of credit attributable to the new lower middle-income status coupled with sanctions by Washington over a deteriorating human rights situation, drove the Rajapaksa government towards accepting a series of high interest loans from Beijing for infrastructure investment. By 2005, China was funding more than 70% of Sri Lanka’s infrastructure projects, including the now infamous Hambantota port."

In this way, the regime’s pursuit of anti-corruption reforms has served to consolidate and centralise power in the hands of CPP elites. For this reason, we suggest that donors interested in pursuing anti-corruption reforms that further assist the liberalisation of the economy, such as PFMR and other efficiency type reforms, will likely continue to find favour. We suggest this holds true even as Cambodia pivots politically and economically to China, fuelling anxiety about corruption on both sides."

This U4 Issue considers the puzzle of Cambodia’s recent anti-corruption regime in light of the country’s changing political economy. It examines anti-corruption reforms undertaken over the 2008-2018 period, focusing on two broad areas: public finance and administration, and decentralisation for increased governance transparency and accountability. The paper develops a comparative political economy analysis with the case of anti-corruption efforts in China, with the aim of exploring likely future outcomes of reform programmes in Cambodia.",
  "mainPoints": [
    "A number of anti-corruption initiatives have been successfully implemented in Cambodia in the face of increasingly authoritarian rule on the part of the Cambodian People’s Party.",
    "Cambodia’s anti-corruption reforms are fundamentally liberal rather than democratic in orientation, which implies regime-friendly and selective implementation.",
    "Liberal anti-corruption reforms such as public finance management reform, public expenditure tracking surveys and decentralisation reform, effectively deepen Cambodia’s market capitalism and provide ways for the neopatrimonial state to rationalise and reorganise the shadow economy, and consolidate power relations.",
    "Arresting current reform dynamics would require a reorganisation and reconsolidation of Cambodia’s anti-corruption coalition.",
    "Strategies for deepening Cambodia’s anti-corruption reforms need to distinguish more rigorously between liberal and democratic notions of accountability and be clear-eyed about exactly how interventions will deliver democratic dividends."

Secondly, we argue that Cambodia’s 'neopatrimonialism' sits in tension with more mobile dynamics of power that have been produced through the effects of market capitalism. We contend that economic liberalisation presents new challenges and opportunities for the traditional hierarchy of neopatrimonialism, whereby old elites must accommodate economically ambitious and agile newcomers."
