      <p>Corruption is a sensitive topic. A neutral forum to discuss it openly helps different agents of change find each other. Our advisers facilitate dialogues between development partners at U4 in-country workshops. During the past decade weâ€™ve held over 60 workshops for our partners and their local counterparts. </p>

      <p>We can also assist with staff training and policy advice at headquarters. Or would you like to meet us at a conference? We gladly share our insights at research and policy events, to help advance general anti-corruption knowledge.</p>
