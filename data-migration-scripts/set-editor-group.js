 * There isn't any way to get to users

 * Open the web inspector and look at the XHR requests
 * There you'll find an API call with the usersâ€™ and names
 * in an array.
 *
 * See https://www.sanity.io/docs/data-store/third-party-login#managing-groups-and-users
 * for more information on custom permissions and filters
 *
 * These permissions are _incremental_, which means that if the user
 * is already in another group with broader permissions, narrower permissions
 * here will have no effect.
