/**
 * There isn't any way to get to users
 * via the API yet. To get user ids go to
 * https://manage.sanity.io/projects/1f1lcoov/team
 * Open the web inspector and look at the XHR requests
 * There you'll find an API call with the usersâ€™ and names
 * in an array.
 *
 * See https://www.sanity.io/docs/data-store/third-party-login#managing-groups-and-users
 * for more information on custom permissions and filters
 *
 * These permissions are _incremental_, which means that if the user
 * is already in another group with broader permissions, narrower permissions
 * here will have no effect.
 *
 * To run this script you need to make an .env-file in the /backend-folder, and add EDITOR_GROUP=<comma separated ids of the editors>
 * Run the script with sanity exec data-migration-scripts/set-editor-group.js --with-user-token
