<p>Community-driven development is a widely employed development strategy for empowering people to choose their own development priorities, to select their own project leaders, and to monitor the implementation of their projects. It is often assumed that this model results in lower corruption rates. In this paper we take a look at two such projects, the Arid Lands Project in Kenya and the KDP/PNPM project in Indonesia.

<p>Community-driven development is a widely employed development strategy for empowering people to choose their own development priorities, to select their own project leaders, and to monitor the implementation of their projects. One aim of CDD is to lower the level of corruption by increasing monitoring through community participation. Realizing this aim relies on two key assumptions. First, CDD is supposed to be more transparent than alternative development models due to reduced information asymmetries between beneficiaries and project staff. Second, villagers should be actively engaged and monitor the performance of those to whom they have delegated these responsibilities.</p>
<p>This new U4 issue paper examines two CDD projects, the Arid Lands Project in Kenya and the KDP/PNPM project in Indonesia. These projects had strikingly different corruption rates, even though the countries in which they operated had similar corruption perception rates at the beginning of the projects. This paper examines the project design differences that may explain this variation.  The Kenyan villagers consistently confronted a wall of silence regarding project specifications and expenditure data. This lack of information, together with poor training about their rights, affected their ability to choose projects and leaders, to monitor leaders and staff, and to blow the whistle about suspected irregularities. Transparency was also a problem in the Indonesian project. However, a key difference is that the Indonesian project took bold steps to fight for more openness. This variation points toward differences in the management culture at the top of the projects.</p>
<p>Four key lessons for preventing corruption in community-driven development projects emerged from this research. First, tone at the top matters: the top management of the Indonesian project took anti-corruption seriously, which created an organizational culture that demonstrated with actions, not just rhetoric, that they were serious about reforms and open to external criticism that might help them fight corruption. Second, the Indonesian project succeeded in reducing corruption because it avoided critical hotspots of government corruption, including the use of civil servants as facilitators and engineers. Third, staff in the Indonesian project had no discretionary decision-making powers in choosing project villages, and competition was a core principle of project elements. Finally, transparency mechanisms functioned better in the Indonesian project and villagers were more able to access information about projects in order to monitor them. In contrast, the Kenyan project failed on all four of these lessons, and as a result, corruption was rampant in the project.</p>
<p>In 2016, U4 partnered with <a href=\"http://michaelnest.com/\">Dr. Michael Nest</a>, an independent consultant with expertise in community development, and German Development Cooperation (KfW) to put into practice the insights from this research. U4 worked with <a href=\"http://www.aris.kg/en\">ARIS</a>, The Community Development and Investment Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic, to design a training seminar and manual for use by ARIS trainers working with local communities benefiting from ARIS funds. This six-hour training seminar is designed to help prevent corruption in community-driven development projects, and was tailored to the local context. </p>

<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Main implications that donors should know about</span></strong></p>
<p><em>by Fredrik Eriksson</em></p>
<p>To citizens in many countries, the words <em>lobbying</em> and <em>corruption</em> are virtually synonymous. It is important to recognise, that while both lobbying and corrupt activities seek to influence government, there are nevertheless clear and obvious distinctions between the two. For example, lobbying is legal, while corruption is not. Moreover, lobbying does not <em>clearly</em> entail any breach of trust, while corruption does. In addition, lobbying seeks to influence government decisions by providing information that may or may not satisfy a certain interest, while corruption seeks to influence government authority through some means that provide a ?private gain.? Finally, an important difference is that corruption is, of course, considered bad by anti-corruption advocates, while lobbying to influence policymaking is not viewed as a corrupt or illegitimate activity by itself. Rather, it is often viewed as an important element of government decision-making processes in many developed countries. Furthermore, recent research has suggested that lobbying can be viewed as a substitute to corruption.</p>
<p>But does this mean that lobbying should be part of the anti-corruption agenda as a substitute for corruption? Can it be effective in reducing corruption especially in contexts where corruption is particularly problematic? As a means to provide information to influence government decisions, lobbying may even be an easier way for development partners to approach the sensitive issue of addressing corruption.</p>
<p>If there is one thing anti-corruption reformers have learned, it is that many anti-corruption efforts have had little expected effect. If anti-corruption reformers begin to push the notion that lobbying can be a substitute for corruption in a specific country, this encouragement must be accompanied by a <em>lobbying regime plan</em>, which is <em>a configuration of lobbying norms and possibly rules</em>. But a good lobbying regime plan cannot and should not be developed before knowing more about the relationship between both lobbying regimes and corruption, and lobbying regimes and governance regimes. As these relationships may differ across contexts, it is important that any such initiatives are based on specific country research, and not imported from other countries with unrelated contexts. </p>
<p>Consequently, as research on these relationships in developing country contexts hardly exist, the main recommendation is that donors and others seek to learn more. Only thereafter will we know if this indeed can become a new anti-corruption measure and under what circumstances it can be effective. </p>" }

<p><strong style=\"font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;\">Series Editor, Aled Williams, on why this U4 Issue matters for donors</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Trading in corruption: How effectively responding to corruption in the sale of oil and minerals could help reduce poverty and aid reliance</strong></h3>
<p>Terms such as ?resource curse challenges?, ?political economy problems? and ?illicit financial flows? have all become part of the common parlance of anti-corruption work. Policy and academic discussions abound on the factors that determine corruption in resource cursed contexts, and what to do about it. Yet, until recently, there has been hardly any policy or academic discussion of corruption risks associated with producer countries? sales of so-called ?hard commodities? such as oil or minerals. This is despite a recent increase in the significance of commodity production for developing country economies, and the well-known corruption challenges found in the extractive industries. This U4 Issue, based on fresh analysis of Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) reports and drawing on a database of 60 corruption cases in the trading of oil and minerals, identifies why commodity trading comes with a high risk of corruption:</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">1.  Selling oil and minerals involves huge financial values</span></strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">The huge financial values raise the stakes involved in particular trading outcomes. Oil sales by the governments of the 10 largest producers in sub-Saharan Africa equaled 56% of their combined revenues between 2011 and 2013. To put this in perspective, the value of national oil company sales in Angola is around seven times as large as the country?s health budget.</span></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">2. Sales of oil and minerals, and the actors involved in such sales, are largely opaque</span><br/></strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">An assessment of state owned enterprises active in oil and mineral trading has found that 18 of 45 are under no legal obligation to report on their operations. It is generally impossible to know, even in an aggregate way, to whom commodities are sold and at what price, although some state owned enterprises do, from time to time, publish detailed figures on their trading activities.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> </span></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">3. Trading in commodities is not specifically regulated in any of the home states of companies active in trading oil and minerals</span><br/></strong></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">While this does not place firms above the law, a lack of specific regulations implies that there are few legal requirements on the way commodities are traded, on the conditions under which companies carry out such trading, and on the type of organisation required to minimise corruption risk.  </span><br/><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">Unfortunately, corruption in the trading of oil and minerals is not merely a theoretical risk, as case examples in the U4 Issue show. Although not the most recent example studied, the </span><em style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">Oil for Food</em><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px; font-family: sans-serif, Calibri;\"> scandal is perhaps the most notorious. Between 1996 and 2003, companies paid bribes to Saddam Hussein?s regime to obtain deliveries of crude oil, whose allocation was supervised by the United Nations. By paying a commission amounting to a few cents per barrel to the Baathist regime, these traders bought oil at a price slightly higher than that established by the UN, but always lower than the market price. An independent inquiry into the scandal found that 139 of 248 companies that participated in the </span><em style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">Oil for Food</em><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px; font-family: sans-serif, Calibri;\"> programme paid bribes to Iraq, totaling USD 229 million. </span></p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px; font-family: sans-serif, Calibri;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">In contrast to the early focus of anti-corruption initiatives on down- and mid-stream extractive industry activities, there are signs that some policymakers in both producing and buying states are beginning to take corruption in commodity trading more seriously. In 2016 the OECD identified for the first time specific measures to mitigate corruption during commodity sales, while an Anti-Corruption Summit in London led to statements from eleven participating countries (including producers Nigeria and Ghana and trading hubs Switzerland and the UK) highlighting the need to enhance information disclosure by companies to governments on sales of oil, gas and minerals. Given estimates that some 70% of people living in extreme poverty are in commodity-rich developing countries, initiatives that help reduce corruption not only in granting contracts or licenses related to extractive operations, but also in oil and mineral sales, could have significant impacts in reducing poverty and potentially decrease reliance on aid. The U4 Issue highlights why the time has come for specific measures in this direction, including on the part of countries with dual roles as commodity trading hubs </span><em style=\"font-size: 10.001px;\">and</em><span style=\"font-size: 10.001px; font-family: sans-serif, Calibri;\"> bilateral aid donors to oil and mineral producing developing countries. </span></p>

<p><span>Las iniciativas de sociedad civil que tienen como objetivo central la promoción de la rendición de cuentas (RdC), tienen el potencial de producir cambios institucionales más duraderos cuando están enfocadas a atender no sólo las consecuencias de una deficiente RdC, sino sus causas, y cuando además orientan sus esfuerzos hacia la incidencia en la toma de decisiones en estructuras de poder en múltiples niveles de gobierno, y no únicamente en el ámbito local. El presente <em>Documento Temático</em> [<em>Issue Paper</em>] analiza una iniciativa de integración vertical para el monitoreo y la incidencia pública desde la sociedad civil. Se entiende por ?integración vertical? las interrelaciones entre actores locales, subnacionales, nacionales e internacionales. El presente documento ofrece un diálogo entre dos perspectivas complementarias: una visión panorámica de tipo académico sobre el enfoque estratégico denominado ?integración vertical?, organizado en torno a cinco propuestas, en diálogo con un análisis profundo y detallado, desde la práctica, sobre la iniciativa ?Conteo de Libros de Texto? (<em>Textbook Count</em>) realizada por una coalición de organizaciones civiles en Filipinas.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Las iniciativas de sociedad civil que tienen como objetivo central la promoción de la rendición de cuentas (RdC), tienen el potencial de producir cambios institucionales más duraderos cuando están enfocadas a atender no sólo las consecuencias de una deficiente RdC, sino sus causas, y cuando además orientan sus esfuerzos hacia la incidencia en la toma de decisiones en estructuras de poder en múltiples niveles de gobierno, y no únicamente en el ámbito local. El presente &lt;em&gt;Documento Temático&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Issue Paper&lt;/em&gt;] analiza una iniciativa de integración vertical para el monitoreo y la incidencia pública desde la sociedad civil.

<p>This paper analyses patterns of corruption and corruption risks related to community mineral beneficiation schemes (CMBSs) that distribute benefits funded by mineral revenues to communities. It analyses insights from existing scholarship on CMBSs, evidence from seven cases of corruption, and lessons from guidance documents on reducing corruption in the mining value chain. The aim of the paper is to stimulate debate and further research about the suitability of anti-corruption strategies for CMBSs. It argues a key flaw in these materials is that they lose sight of the fundamental purpose of CBMSs: local-level development controlled by the community. Existing work on corruption in CMBSs places too much emphasis on administrative measures to manage risks and prevent wrongdoing. A better approach is to first understand local political dynamics and ambitions for development, and then use these insights to improve CMBS design. The optimal mix of anti-corruption initiatives will flow from this work, including clarity about which measures are best controlled by which stakeholders. This paper makes 10 policy recommendations to improve CMBS design or reform CBMSs so they deliver benefits, enhance community control over development and better control corruption.</p>
<h2><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Approaches for donors in preventing corruption in community mineral beneficiation schemes</span></h2>
<p>Community benefit schemes in the mining sector are vulnerable to corruption. Donors can help to mitigate these risks ? and improve development outcomes for mining-affected local communities ? in several ways:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Research</strong><br/> Donors can encourage and work with mining operators to research local relationships with government authorities and mining companies and to map out local power dynamics. This research should entail surveying the development aspirations of both mining-affected communities and local government units. </li>
<li><strong>Appropriate schemes</strong><br/> Donors can work with mining operators to determine if, in fact, a community benefit scheme is the best way to distribute mineral revenues, or if an alternative like cash transfers should instead be considered. </li>
<li><strong>Flexible design</strong><br/> If a benefit scheme is established, donors can encourage mining operators to create a well-designed, properly documented and justified scheme that can be adjusted if problems arise but that also includes credible mechanisms to investigate and prosecute corrupt behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Regular communication</strong><br/> Finally, donors can encourage mining operators to engage in continuous communication with beneficiary communities about the operation of a benefit sharing scheme to prevent information asymmetries that can facilitate corruption.</li>

Since then, levels of insecurity in the country have seen a marked rise and the number of internally displaced people in the country has doubled. Levels of optimism about the overall direction of the country and confidence in government in 2015 fell to their lowest levels in a decade.</p>
<p>Corruption in Afghanistan is endemic and has penetrated all parts of the Afghan state, adversely affecting the ability of Afghanistan to maintain security for its citizens and deliver basic public services. Corruption is also increasingly embedded in social practices, with patronage politics and bribery becoming an acceptable part of daily life.

<p>Development assistance has not been immune to this phenomenon. Indeed the large influx of money and poor oversight of contracting and procurement related to the international presence is believed to have exacerbated the problem.

While anti-corruption agencies with investigative and/or prosecutorial powers have attracted more attention, judicial specialisation is an increasingly common feature of national anti-corruption reform strategies.</p>
<p>The most common argument for the creation of special anti-corruption courts is the need for greater efficiency in resolving corruption cases promptly and the associated need to signal to various domestic and international audiences that the country takes the fight against corruption seriously. In some countries, concerns about the ability of the ordinary courts to handle corruption cases impartially, and without being corrupted themselves, have also played an important role in the decision to create special anti-corruption courts.</p>
<p>Existing specialised anti-corruption courts differ along a number of dimensions, including their size, their place in the judicial hierarchy, mechanisms for selection and removal of judges, the substantive scope of the courts? jurisdiction, trial and appellate procedures, and their relationship with anti-corruption prosecutors. These institutional design choices imply a number of difficult trade-offs: while there are no definitive ?best practices? for specialised anti-corruption courts, existing models and experience may provide some guidance to reformers considering similar institutions. They must decide whether such a court should adopt procedures that are substantially different from those of other criminal courts, and/or special provisions for the selection, removal, or working conditions of the anti-corruption court judges.</p>

The research combines two  complementary perspectives: a scholar?s overview of this strategic  approach, including five propositions on vertical integration, in  dialogue with a practitioner?s in-depth analysis of Textbook Count in  the Philippines, a civil society coalition which, in partnership with  government reformers, provided independent monitoring of an entire  supply chain in the education sector.

Based on a survey and interviews among key informants in U4?s partner agencies in 2014, we found a variety of anti-corruption tools already included in the agencies? bilateral judicial reform programmes. The tools are not frequently employed, yet, and they are sometimes implemented under a different label to avoid the sensitive implications of tackling corruption among those charged with upholding the law. Remarkable is the absence of support for the use of many control and oversight tools, budgeting and procurement tools, and some human resource instruments to prevent and detect corruption in the judicial sector.</p>
<p>The general perception of the survey respondents is that it is at least partly the lack of internal donor capacity and expertise in adapting existing anti-corruption tools to the judicial sector that underlies the absence of these instruments from bilateral judicial reform programmes.

Yet there is now increasing interest in a third way, commonly refered to as the ?nested approach?, which aims to allow projects and national government-led REDD+ to coexists.  The paper considers this for Tanzania, but argues the nested approach, as it is typically conceptualised, is unconvincing and also raises concerns with high risks of fraud and corruption. Tanzania therefore face a serious dilemma in moving forward with REDD+, and new ideas are needed on its design. The paper describes a different approach to understanding ?nested? governance for REDD+, which shifts REDD+ away from the hazards of a market based system and emphasises deliberative democracy for achieving REDD+ at the national scale. It also raises questions over the viability of continuing to link REDD+ payments only to a carbon metric. </p>" }

<p>Large-scale mining of minerals and metals are threatening protected areas, and corruption is often to blame. International donors must engage with governments, mining companies and local stakeholders to encourage transparency and accountability around restrictions and concessions. Donors are well-placed to promote adherence to international laws and initiatives designed to safeguard biologically- and culturally sensitive areas.

Undue external interference with an anti-corruption agency (ACA) is likely to target its top officials; if co-opted or corrupted, they can do serious damage to the effectiveness and reputation of an ACA. Appointment and removal processes affect the actual and perceived impartiality of ACAs. If an ACA head can be appointed and removed at will by a political stakeholder, the appointee has an incentive to defer to the will of the appointer. Some countries have therefore made such appointments the shared responsibility of several institutions to avoid potential misuse of the ACA by the government or a particular political group. In addition to who has responsibility for appointments, the criteria for eligibility and the transparency of the selection criteria and process also matter. The inclusion or exclusion of a certain group of candidates can have an effect on the actual and perceived impartiality, competence, and responsiveness of the head of the agency. The inclusion of non-state actors, for example, is likely to gain more public trust than limiting candidates to party office holders.</p>
<p>Removal procedures can be as important as appointment procedures. Security of tenure needs to be weighed against accountability. The implicit or explicit threat of removal can be a powerful incentive for the ACA head to align with specific interests. Removal procedures become important when those whose interests are threatened try to influence and ? if unsuccessful ? remove key decision makers. Removal, however, can also be needed to replace leaders who are corrupt, politically driven, or simply incompetent. It is therefore important to outline clearly the removal procedures, keeping in mind both the independence of the agency and the accountability of top officials.</p>" }

Since 2011, the country has been creating key pieces of legislation as well as implementing REDD+ readiness activities and making pilot investments to mitigate some of the key drivers of deforestation and forest degradation identified in the country. Despite this progress, the country?s poor governance climate creates a significant challenge in future progress towards implementing REDD+. Endemic poverty, weak state authority, and widespread corruption characterize the DRC?s current political environment. It is within this socioeconomic and political backdrop that the REDD+ mechanism is expected to be implemented in the DRC.<br/><br/>The main objective of this study is to assess national-level corruption risks and possible anticorruption strategies in REDD+ implementation in the DRC, using a combination of desk and field-based research. The findings from this research suggest that four types of corruption have arisen in relation to national-level REDD+ implementation: (1) kickback payments; (2) the politicization of government forestry positions; (3) financial mismanagement by international development cooperation agencies and non-governmental organizations; and (4) non-transparent hiring practices of international consultants. The key recommendation of this paper, based on these findings, is the establishment of an independent agency in the DRC to monitor REDD+ finances and projects. Such an agency could play a strong role in enhancing and enforcing the DRC?s legal and institutional framework, enhancing transparency through the publication of license and REDD+ information, providing ethics education, and helping to ensure merit-based employment in REDD+ institutions.</p>

<p>Much of what is known about corruption at the different stages of the criminal justice system comes from developed country experiences. In many cases, however, the drivers of corruption are the same across all countries. In using the available set of tools to assess corruption risks in criminal trials and appeals, the greatest challenge for practitioners is finding the relevant parts of general assessment tools that assess the particular corruption risks. The paper concludes with an appeal for integrated corruption risk assessment tools and accessible reporting. Only a sector-wide lens will allow identification of the linkages and dependencies within the criminal justice chain, providing a basis for targeted reform efforts and a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy.</p>

Hypotheses from professional opinions such as those cited in this paper are empirically testable, and results could be quickly incorporated into useful advice for correctional administrators.</p>

Only a few cross-country assessments, such as evaluations by the Council of Europe and the Organization for American States, have been conducted to date. Nonetheless, a basic assessment of corruption risks ? followed by appropriate adjustments to policies and processes ? can be done with limited resources, and with external expert advice if needed. The key success factor for this approach is leadership commitment. Agency leaders need to protect their staff from exposure to corruption opportunities, identify corruption risks in all operations and decision-making processes, and use the results to establish clear policies, guidelines, and performance standards, as well as systems for internal review.</p>

In general, complicated interventions such as national anti-corruption strategies or anti-corruption agencies do not lend themselves easily to cost-analysis approaches, often due to the challenge of measuring the impact in terms of reduced corruption. However, cost-effectiveness analysis ? and in some cases cost-benefit analysis ? of sector programmes with inbuilt anti-corruption measures is a useful tool for guiding decision makers as they choose between alternative integrity measures and assess the return on investment. Cost-benefit analysis hinges on an ability to translate outcomes into a monetary value, something most feasible with public finance?related interventions. Where outcomes cannot be monetised, there are still opportunities for cost-effectiveness analysis. Two impact evaluation designs are presented that make use of cost-effectiveness analysis to overcome corruption measurement challenges. Using such designs, the value of anti-corruption activities can be evaluated even without measuring corruption.</p>" }

Asset recovery ? the process of identifying, restraining, seizing, and repatriating these assets to the countries from whence they were originally stolen ? is one of the greatest challenges for the global anti-corruption movement. Asset recovery is also an essential development challenge, as it usually involves repatriating funds back to a developing country where they were stolen, and where they could be used to support development projects. As a bridge between aid recipient and donor countries, donor agencies are uniquely positioned to support asset recovery initiatives. Interesting examples are emerging of how donors can support asset recovery by: (i) supporting international standards and initiatives; (ii) providing technical assistance and capacity building (most often through third parties); (iii) encouraging policy coherence at home; (iv) helping build political will; and (v) providing assistance during the asset repatriation phase.</p>" }

The National Water Directorate in Mozambique is one of the few public sector departments in the world known to have allocated its own resources to developing a sector-specific anti-corruption strategy. Its experience offers valuable lessons for others considering integrating anti-corruption in sectors. Leadership needs to come from ministries with intersectoral mandates or through formal collaboration between different ministries. Government-led processes must be complemented by locally driven social accountability processes. Sector strategies need strong political commitment, at sector and central government levels, since multi-stakeholder processes are complex and time-consuming, and the implementation of sector strategies must include sector-level human resources and management systems.</p>" }

Many anti-corruption actions are in place in the pilot sites, but they are weakly embedded in social relations at the local level. More work is required to raise awareness of the benefits of governance safeguards to livelihoods and security of land tenure.

En este U4 Issue, estudiamos una selección de iniciativas globales en el área de buena gobernabilidad y medicamentos que han sido implementadas desde el año 2000. Estas iniciativas adoptadas por el Banco Mundial, la Organización Mundial de la Salud y el Fondo Global, así como por la Alianza para la Transparencia de Medicamentos, han sido especialmente útiles para generar un diálogo político y de políticas públicas alrededor de la buena gobernabilidad del sector farmacéutico. Se puede concluir que estas iniciativas identifican las debilidades del sistema farmacéutico y pueden proporcionar información importante para establecer una línea de base. Han sido valiosas para incrementar la toma de consciencia sobre el tema, y en algunos casos también han creado importantes alianzas entre múltiples actores interesados e implementado iniciativas de buena gobernabilidad específicas al sector. Sin embargo, frecuentemente existe una amplia brecha entre la identificación de los problemas, el diseño estratégico para enfrentarlos y la implementación. Los instrumentos usados suelen centrarse en las reglas, procedimientos y prácticas que se presume previenen la corrupción en el sector público, pero podrían no capturar suficientemente bien las complejas dinámicas que llevan a la corrupción. Las recomendaciones incluyen la necesidad de más análisis político, y de monitoreo y evaluación?particularmente sobre la medición de resultados?así como la racionalización y homogeneización de los instrumentos de evaluación en todas las instituciones.</span></p>" }

Promoting rule of law, particularly through ?strengthening law enforcement?, is an important part of improving forest management and ensuring justice for forest dependent communities. This includes strengthening police and the courts to better detect and punish illegal forest activities. However, available evidence has shown that strong law enforcement activities often fail to address broader systems of illegal activities and can lead to further injustices. Corruption is one reason for these failures and is the focus of this U4 Issue Paper, which draws lessons from Cameroon and Indonesia. Efforts to strengthen law enforcement in the forests need to consider how corruption may interfere with successful detection and suppression of illegal activities. If they are to be successful, programmes promoting forest law enforcement in corrupt contexts also need to be sensitive to how they are implemented, with particular focus on the rights of forest dependent communities.</span></p>" }

While many African countries do not have a strong track record of managing mineral wealth well, Ghana is often considered a model of best practice, based on its policy of distributing a proportion of mining rents to local authorities and traditional leaders in mining affected communities. In this paper the authors review this policy and, contrary to the positive view of some experts, they explain that forms of corruption and mismanagement undermine it. The paper considers the policy implications. Two complimentary policy goals represent the usual remedies for combatting corruption; increasing transparency and improving social accountability. Both of these objectives are important, but the authors identify a number of potential limitations to their implementation. A third policy that is gaining more international support is also considered, which involves using the wealth from natural resource sectors to fund a universal cash transfer scheme. The paper considers the feasibility and potential benefits of this in Ghana, not only in terms of improving the developmental contribution of mineral wealth, but also how a cash transfer scheme may overcome corruption and poor governance.</span></p>" }

Anti-corruption is a challenging field in this regard, with few evidence-based models to draw upon, so both the design and the evaluation of programmes need to be supported by good analytical frameworks. The theory of change (ToC) approach focuses on how and why an initiative works. Constructing a ToC enables government and donor staff to identify the logic underpinning their programmes and clarify how interventions are expected to lead to the intended results. The paper presents a user-friendly five-step methodology for building a theory of change for a programme or project. It highlights the importance of preconditions, factors that must be in place for the intervention to work as intended, distinguishing between those preconditions that can be addressed by the programme design and those that cannot. Finally, the paper provides general and sector-specific guidance based on case studies of programmes in three areas: anti-corruption authorities, civil society work, and public sector reforms. Adding complexity as well as realism, the theory of change methodology is a valuable tool for designing, implementing, and evaluating anti-corruption reforms.</p>" }

The report focuses on the key role of elites and their views of the state's legitimacy in determining the extent to which there will be instability or stability. Qualitative interviews of elites show that two particular patronage scenarios are seen as threatening stability. One is when the state or illegal actors sustain a corrupt network by violently eliminating opponents. The other is when corruption benefits few people, the benefits are not distributed ?fairly,? and the population?s basic needs are not met. Public opinion data suggest that despite corruption, the legitimacy of governments and public institutions in the three countries studied is reasonably high. The impact of corruption on legitimacy and stability is mitigated by other factors.  Anti-corruption initiatives potentially strengthen state legitimacy, but undermine it if they fail to deliver or become too far-reaching. In conclusion, the report makes recommendations to the international community for prioritising action on corruption.</span></p>" }

The British Department for International Development (DFID) led an approach that draws on ideas from the OECD DAC Anti-Corruption Task Team, but was tailored to the local context. A year and a half later, the approach was showing promising results in terms of establishing a common platform for dialogue, improving the design of safeguards against corruption in other donor programmes, and encouraging anti-corruption allies in Uganda. The record is more mixed on the impact of sanctions, and sustainability of the donor effort remains a challenge. The Uganda experience suggests that an effective Joint Response to Corruption requires, among other things, investing in leadership for the initiative, building a strong base of evidence and analysis, and maintaining flexibility in order to seize opportunities to advance the anti-anticorruption agenda.</p>

This issue paper reviews the literature on natural resources and on trust. The existing theoretical and empirical literature suggests that natural resources can reduce trust through several indirect mechanisms. Notably, studies show that natural resources lead to institutional degradation, corruption, inequality, and civil war, all of which have been associated with reduced trust. The paper tests empirically whether there is a direct effect of natural resources on trust (The Pearl Hypothesis), using cross-country data. The results indicate that no such direct effect exists, suggesting that any effect of resources on trust runs through intermediate variables such as institutions, corruption, inequality, and civil war. Importantly, however, the relationship between corruption and trust turns out to be non-linear, indicating that the effect of natural resources on trust depends on the initial corruption level of a country.</p>" }

Any attempt to reform such practices must start with a clear understanding of the incentives for abuse and adopt multifaceted strategies.

<p>A comparison with another such institution in a very similar neighbouring country ? the Office of the Ombudsman of the Philippines ? illustrates the KPK?s success especially in investigating and prosecuting corrupt public officials. Why was the KPK, in just five years, able to reach a 100% conviction rate against top officials in all major branches of the Indonesian government, while the Philippine Ombudsman has scored only few convictions in its 20-year history? Part of this success can be explained by considerable investigative powers given to KPK, which the Philippine Ombudsman does not hold. Also, rigorous pre-testing of every prosecution and a highly efficient anti-corruption court contribute to KPK?s success.

However, it has been empirically shown that there is a weak correlation between social spending and outcomes, even if we account for national incomes (World Bank 2008). Many factors have been identified as possible causes of this situation, including market failures, composition of spending, corruption and effectiveness of social service delivery. A body of research on public expenditure in democratic regimes argues that one of the reasons for such underperformance is manipulation by political leaders of the timing and allocation of expenditures with the aim of re-election. Increases in public expenditures have been timed to coincide with elections and expenditures have been directed toward areas in which their political impact was likely to be largest, discriminating against other areas on the basis of political calculus rather than social or poverty-based criteria.</p>

Este U4 Issue Paper explora las lecciones aprendidas de la convención anticorrupción más antigua - la Convención Interamericana Contra la Corrupción (CICC) - la cual da insumos útiles para los requerimientos de un mecanismo de seguimiento. En las Américas tal como en otras partes, hay a menudo una brecha entre aspectos formales (legales) de reformas y las realidades de la implementación. Este estudio analiza el mecanismo de seguimiento de la CICC e identifica sus fortalezas y debilidades al generar información sobre cambios formales e información sobre cambios reales (resultados e impactos) en los países. Se brinda especial atención al desarrollo de un Mapa de Indicadores que mide la implementación de unas provisiones claves de la CICC en Guatemala. El estudio sostiene que fortalecer el desarrollo de sistemas y capacidades nacionales de información puede generar conocimientos más objetivos sobre el grado de implementación de reformas anticorrupción. Especialmente el uso de indicadores de desempeño es esencial para evaluaciones y debates significativos sobre el estado de implementación de una convención en un país dado.</p>

Second, policies to tackle both problems are usually developed without applying sound principles of policy?making. The author argues for the development of policies based on proper analysis of the specific context, breaking down the problem into clear components, identifying their causes, and selecting specific and appropriate measures to address each component or causal factor.

In the Americas, as elsewhere, there is often a gap between formal (legal) aspects of reform and the reality of implementation. This paper analyses the IACAC review mechanism and identifies strengths and weaknesses in generating legal and performance related information about the implementation of the convention. Special emphasis is given to the development of an indicator map to assess some key areas of IACAC implementation in Guatemala. The paper argues that strengthening national information systems and information management capacities can generate more objective knowledge about the progress of anti corruption reforms. Performance indicators, in particular, are necessary for meaningful assessments of, and debates about, the status of a convention?s implementation within a particular country.</p>

At regional levels, the World Bank governance indicators, TI Corruption Perception Index, the Southern African Democracy Barometer as well as TI? Global Corruption Barometer provide valuable information on the extent of corruption in Africa. At the national level, various corruption surveys have been conducted in Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda between 1996 and 2003. Corruption in Africa is not only perceived to be widespread but costly. There have been attempts to quantify the impact of corruption on the national economy, aid effectiveness, revenue collection and household expenditure. But the cost of corruption can not only be measured in terms of the loss of funds but also in terms of delayed development and increased inequalities.</p>" }

International organisations have also recommended establishing courts devoted to corruption cases in other countries such as Nigeria, Romania, Morocco or Bangladesh. Their need and effectiveness has been debated over time. Some countries have used a unified general system with judges who have already acquired expertise in handling corruption cases. One of the risks associated with special corruption courts is their potential of being misused for political purposes, as it has been suggested in the case of the Pakistan?s National Accountability Bureau.</p>" }

Traditionally, the French administrative system evolved around the notion of a unitary state, reflected in the strong emphasis on hierarchy and reporting lines. The French administration is accountable for its actions to the executive and to a number of other watchdog organisations. However, even across countries that have inherited the French systems, legal and administrative practices, as well as levels and forms of corruption, may vary significantly. Anti-corruption systems established in Benin, Senegal and Niger, for example, indicate that choices made with regard to the setting and operation of state control institutions, prosecution measures or systemic reforms depend on the specific political circumstance of each country. At the international level, Francophone Africa is characterised by a Franco-African model of relations and ties that introd</p>" }

The functioning of contemporary democracies necessitates political financing and the combination of private and public funding sources. However, there is a strong need to control unfair and illegal practices and to regulate political finance in light of the role political parties play in the democratic process. Attempts to regulate political finance typically include codes of conducts for political parties, disclosure rules, contributions. and expenditure limits. A number of factors are likely to have an impact on the effectiveness of such regulatory regimes, including the quality of the regulation as well as political will and commitment. Public agencies in charge of ensuring effective implementation of political finance regulations vary from country to country (e.g. governmental departments, the Attorney General, audit offices or state controller). The scope of their mandate, independence, technical and financial capacity are contributing f" }
